# my silly little synthesizer

A silly little synth project that I built with React & Vite, with tonejs for sounds and a sprinkling of styled-components and react-use-keypress.

after cloning:

pnpm install
pnpm run dev

*** Warning!!! ***
This is unfinished and gets real tweaky sometimes. I suspect the callstack is getting overloaded. Typically a page refresh will do the trick to make it sound sorta normal again. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
